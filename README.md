# HTML5-Graphics

Some experiences with HTML5 canvas, graphics and libraries.

Most of the examples come from old books, mostly in BASIC (8-bit), 
and I will be porting or retrofitting them to work with modern tools 
such as HTML5 canvas, python and so on.

Remembering the old type-in books and magazines, 
it always amazed me how some lines of BASIC code could generate 
awesome graphics on the screen.

A couple of decades later I am looking back at them and try to understand how they work
and what mathematical formulas are behind.
